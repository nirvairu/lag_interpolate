An old project I made to visualize Lagrange interpolation

I really don't know why some comments are in _Hindi_, but I will be preserving this for
the sake of history.

the code is very messy, but I'm somewhat proud of this project This was during an
obsessive micro optimisation phase and was my first attempt at writing an actual tool in C
I spent a good while working out how to store and render everything from a single array,
especially since I never used testing or debuggers just printfs and elbow grease. :-)
