# An old project I made to visualize Lagrange interpolation

**WARNING: WILL BREAK TERMINALS WHICH DO NOT SUPPORT COMPLEX TEXT LAYOUT __(MOST OF THEM)__**
I really don't know why some comments are in _Hindi_, but I will be preserving this for
the sake of history :p

FYI: Code is very messy, Still proud of this project :-) This was during my obsessive
micro optimisation phase and a lot of engineering was devoted to properly render
everything in a single array, This was also before I tried using debuggers.
